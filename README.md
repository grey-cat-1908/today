# TODAY

Everyday data generation using my weird constants generation algorithms.
Based on today's midnight timestamp, works locally on the client side.


## Short algorithms description

* [v1 README](https://github.com/grey-cat-1908/today/blob/master/v1.md) - about emoji and color generation

* [Tupper's self-referential formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupper's_self-referential_formula) + something wierd 


## Demo

* [Emoji + Color](https://today.mrkrk.me/)

* [Pixel Art](https://today.mrkrk.me/art)


## The purpose of this project

This project is useless. I like creating some weird algorithms. Here, I show how these formulas can be used to create other types of data.
Also, I think it's cool when something changes daily.
