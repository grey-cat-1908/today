# TODAY

Everyday data generation using my weird constants generation algorithms.
Based on today's midnight timestamp, works locally on the client side.


## Demo

* [Emoji + Color](https://today.mrkrk.me/)

* [Pixel Art](https://today.mrkrk.me/art)

* [Region](https://today.mrkrk.me/region)


## The purpose of this project

This project is useless. I like creating some weird algorithms. Here, I show how these formulas can be used to create other types of data.
Also, I think it's cool when something changes daily.
